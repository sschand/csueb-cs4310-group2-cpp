									Introduction
	This document proposes a possible game, its player objectives, layout, rules and other information.  It reflects on its code structure using the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern and other software development topics and possible requirements.  Now as for the overall concept of a tower defense game its overall simple.  In the game there is a fixed path that non player controlled(NPC) monsters travel on. At the end of this path there usually lies a castle with a certain degree of health. The Npc's goal is to make it to the castle and when they do the health will decrease. The players goal is to build towers which in turn attack and kill the monsters. Some versions of this game include a certain wave(number of rounds) of monsters and afterwards either yield victory or defeat. Overall some features of the game include upgrading towers, to either one form to another or a player choice of usually up to three. Others include elemental towers which either have splash(area of effect) damage, Slow (lowers Npc movement speed), sometimes stunning, or a tower that gives more money per kill. There are hundreds of variations of this game and this will be one of the many.
