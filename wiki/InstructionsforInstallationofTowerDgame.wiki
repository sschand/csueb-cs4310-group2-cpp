= Introduction =

*Currently we are working on being able to create an executable file for Qt that would allow you run the game, thus by-passing all required the steps listed in this wiki to make the game run.

Qt is a programming software used to create software application that utilize a GUI (Graphic User Interface). The coding language we used to create this game was C++.

This is a tower defense game. The object of the game is to prevent monsters to reach your castle. The monsters get killed by towers that are placed along their path of travel. The user places towers along the side of the path and the towers shoot and damage the monsters health. Once the health of the monsters is brought to zero, the monsters die.

Requirements:
             * Must have Qt installed on your machine.

Install step:
             # Download the folder labeld "TowerD.zip" to your desktop or folder of your choice from the downloads section.
             # Extract the files from the folder. (Usually done by right clicking on the zipped folder and clicking on "Extract all". Then just follow the prompts on your screen.)
